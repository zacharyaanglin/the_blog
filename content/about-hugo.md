I'm Zach. I'm a software engineer working remotely in Storrs, Connecticut. I'm into personal finance, exercising in my home gym, and exploring around New England with my wife and son. I don't expect anyone to read this blog, but if you do I hope it is helpful to you. Feel free to drop me a line at zach@anglin.com if I can do anything for you.
