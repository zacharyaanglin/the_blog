Last night, my wife [Kylie](https://www.kylieanglin.com) and I got to go meet CBS This Morning and former Face the Nation host John Dickerson. He talked for a bit about Einstein anticipating the possibility of black holes, but predicting that they didn't exist in reality. Dickerson stressed that this was an example of Einstein's genius -- that he was willing to make a prediction he was unsure of, but was earnestly seeking to find the truth. In Dickerson's words, Einstein was intelligent (TODO -- figure this one out) enough to be wrong.

I wrote this first paragraph along with several others six years ago, before my son was born. I've tried a lot of stuff since then, some has worked, some hasn't, but I'm much farther along in my life journey by any reasonable measurement.
