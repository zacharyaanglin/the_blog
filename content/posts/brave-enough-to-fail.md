Last night, my wife [Kylie](https://www.kylieanglin.com) and I got to go meet CBS This Morning and former Face the Nation host John Dickerson. He talked for a bit about Einstein anticipating the possibility of black holes, but predicting that they didn't exist in reality. Dickerson stressed that this was an example of Einstein's genius -- that he was willing to make a prediction he was unsure of, but was earnestly seeking to find the truth. In Dickerson's words, Einstein was intelligent (TODO -- figure this one out) enough to be wrong.

I've seen this idea -- that we should take more risks because the consequences of failure aren't that catastrophic, as long as we earnestly seek the truth -- in a few other contexts. Joe Rogan argues that we are in the safest period in human history and so insulated from the real risks of failure that we are acting irrationally when we seek to minimize our exposure to things like hunger and financial ruin by working a 9-5 job and going to school. Ray Dalio asserts in _Principles_ that all you really need is food, shelter, and sex, so you should try to maximize your excitement as long as those aren't seriously threatened.

My own best (albeit small) exposure to this sentiment comes from a trivia contest that I played in high school. The Rotary Club of Waco (Texas) sponsored a challenge between schools in the area, sort of similar to Quiz Bowl. It was televised on the local news station, and there was a four-round tournament to win the whole thing. The winner was usually one of the big public schools (Waco, Temple, Belton) or a private school (Vanguard Prep) -- my little rural town had been involved for forty years and only won once (when my dad was the senior captain).

I was pretty good at the challenge team. My freshman year, we made it to the championship and narrowly lost (to Waco ISD). Sophomore and Junior years, we always made it out of the first round, but never quite so far. As a senior, I was the captain (which meant that I mostly was in charge of buzzing in when we thought we could answer a question). The thing is, I realized that getting an answer wrong didn't carry a penalty -- it would give the other team the chance to answer the question, but you wouldn't lose any points. This led me to adopt a strategy:

- If it looks like no one knows the answer to a question, buzz in and make a guess.
- If the other team answers first and gets it wrong, make a guess.

Playing the game this way meant that the only questions I didn't answer are the ones the other team answered first right off the bat. All the other questions, either we buzzed in first and got the question right, or I took a stab at a question that I wasn't sure about -- I didn't leave any potential right answers on the table. Our little teeny rural high school won the contest that year, and we did it despite having more wrong answers than the rest of the teams in the tournament combined. In fact, you could argue that we won _because_ we had so many wrong answers. I think that's probably true -- we wouldn't have won if we hadn't taken so many risks, and I was comfortable with being wrong when those risks didn't pan out.

I think about that frequently. The world is probably similar to that quiz game, in the sense that there's no real penalty to being wrong in public, other than embarrassment -- as long as you're earnestly seeking the truth. I'm working to adopt a mindset that reflects this belief -- take lots of shots and be okay with missing on lots of them. Learn from all the failure, and grow. That seems like the best path to not becoming irrelevant.
