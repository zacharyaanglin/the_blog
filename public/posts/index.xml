      <title>529 plans as sneaky Roth IRAs</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tl;dr: The 529 plan received a not-very-well-publicized buff recently that makes it far more appealing for people who 1) are uncertain about how much they will need to save for college and 2) are maxing out Roth IRAs. I am one of the people that falls into those overlapping circles, so I&amp;rsquo;m writing this post about how to use these plans to supercharge savings.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/529_plan&#34;&gt;529s&lt;/a&gt;  are well-known as a tax shelter for saving for educational purposes. They offer tax-deferred growth that is untaxed for educational purposes and frequently a state tax break. If you&amp;rsquo;re going to have to fund higher-education expenses, it&amp;rsquo;s way better to have the funds for those expenses in a 529 plan than in a taxable account.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
